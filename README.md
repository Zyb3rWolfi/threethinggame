Master Branch - The main branch merges into master branch (STABLE)
Main Branch - All your work is merged with this branch

git pull (pulls from remote)
git branch <name> (create a new local branch)
git branch add . (add all of the changes)
git push (push your changes over to remote)
git merge (merge branches)

Make sure you are working on your LOCAL branch e.g. zakk instead on the MAIN or MASTER. Leave those alone - only pull
